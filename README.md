For our CS 111 final project, we developed an interactive Python-based French language-learning adventure game using Turtle graphics. The game incorporates event-driven design and modular programming to guide users through various mini-games and challenges that reinforce language skills. By integrating dynamic scoring and real-time feedback, the project offers an engaging and educational experience, allowing players to track their progress and improve their language abilities in a fun, interactive way.
